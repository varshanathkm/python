It is an executable file and to organize all the modules we have the concept called Package in Python.\n","\n","* A Python module is a file containing Python code that defines variables, functions, and classes. In modules, code is organized\n","* into logical units, making it easier to reuse code across different parts of a program or across multiple programs.\n","\n","*  Python modules serve several purposes:\n","\n","* Code Organization: Modules make it easier to break down a large program into smaller, more manageable parts. You can import and\n","* use each module to handle specific functions.\n","\n","* Code Reusability: Modules can be imported and used in other Python programs once they have been defined. This helps in writing DRY\n","* (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.\n","\n","* Encapsulation: Modules provide a level of encapsulation, where internal details of a module can be hidden from other parts of the\n","* program, which promotes clean, maintainable code.\n","\n","* Namespace: Each module defines its own namespace, preventing naming conflicts with other modules.\n","\n","* To create a module, you define your Python code in a .py file. For example, if you create a file named test_module.py containing some\n","*  functions, classes, or variables, you can import and use those in other parts of your program using the import statement.\n","\n","* Examples of modules:\n","* Datetime\n","* Regex\n","* Random\n","* calendar"],"metadata":{"id":"lGxJQByx6eKK"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Qom6f3ZS6apX"},"outputs":[],"source":["# way to call other .py file we created as module (contain functions like bulidin created by us)\n","\n","# import addition   # it will import every thing from addition\n","# from addition import sub    # it will import only needed function from file\n","# from addition import sub,add    # it will import only needed function from file\n","# from addition import sub as a  # change function name if the name is big"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# function we created in the .py file as module\n","\n","# def add(x,y):\n","#     return x+y\n","\n","# def sub(x,y):\n","#     return x-y"],"metadata":{"id":"Mx_b0K4Z6lmU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# we call module to the current file we need it to perform function :\n","\n","\n","# import addition   # it will import every thing from addition\n","# from addition import sub    # it will import only needed function from file\n","# from addition import sub,add    # it will import only needed function from file\n","# from addition import sub as a  # change function name if the name is big\n","\n","\n","\n","# res=addition.sub(4,8)\n","# print(res)\n","\n","# res=addition.add(4,8)\n","# print(res)\n","\n","# print(a(4,5))"],"metadata":{"id":"zCIEHjf46oU6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
